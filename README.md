# Artemis-Financial-

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client is Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company who develop plans for savings,retirment,investment and insurance for it's customers. They want us to implment the most current and efficeint software security into their web application programming interface. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing? 

I belive I successcull ran the static test and removeing all false positive particularly well.It is important to code securely so hackers won't be able to exploit your code and get access to important information.Software security protects the companies clients, employees and any other private information that would be disatrous in the wrong hands. Loseing the trust of clients because of data leek could cost current and future business.


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The Vulnerability asseessment Flowchat diagram helped alot in searching the program for vulnerabilities.


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

First I determined the vulnerabilies  before takeing the neccearry actions to secure it. For example, this program had lots of input vulnerablites, as a result i add input validation in hope of countering the vulnerablity.


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Useing a dependency check allowed me to ensure the code and software application were functional and secure. When refactoring code, we can run a second dependency check  and compare it to first to make sure new vulnerabilites weren't added.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The Vulnerability Asseessment Flowchat diagram is a good resource to have for future refrences.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I believe this particular assignment showcase my ablity to search for and assess vulnerablities in a system. An important skill when it comes to eliminating sofeware vulneablities.
